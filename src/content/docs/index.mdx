JS Engine is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), that allows you to easily run JavaScript from within your notes.

## Getting Started

First you will need to install the plugin from the Community Plugins tab in Obsidian's settings.
You can find various guides on how to use the plugin under the Guides section in the sidebar.

If you are looking for examples, you can explore the [example vault](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin/tree/master/exampleVault) which I use for testing.

## Bugs, Errors or Unexpected Behavior?

Please open a bug report on the plugins [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin/issues).

## Have an Idea for a new Feature?

Feature requests and contributions are always welcome.
If you have an idea, feel free to open a feature request under the [issues tab on GitHub](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin/issues) or even create a pull request.
